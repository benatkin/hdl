# Introduction

*Hoisting* and *Deep Linking* are a couple of related software terms I've
encountered recently. They both help large documents behave like smaller
documents.

# Hoisting

I learned about hoisting about a year ago when I encountered outliners.com in
Dave Winer's sidebar. Hoisting is taking one node of an outline and making it
the root node of a view. It dates back until the 80s, and still shows up
today, usually under different names.

## City Example

As an example, I'll use an unordered list, of the [20 largest metropolitain
areas in the U. S., by
state](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_United_States_Metropolitan_Statistical_Areas).
Some of these metro areas are spread across states; I'll use the state which
has most of the metro's people living in it, which is conveniently listed
first. To add an additional level, I've broken these into regions.
